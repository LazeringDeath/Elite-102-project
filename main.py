# In this project you will create an online banking program. Users need to 
# have an account number and PIN to identify themselves as owners of an 
# account. Once users get into the system they will have standard options: 
# check balance, deposit, and withdraw. Additionally, a new user or bank 
# administrator can also create a new account, close account, and modify 
# an account (such as edit name, PIN, or any other personal identification 
# required to open an account).
